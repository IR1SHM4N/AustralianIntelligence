Australia is always looking for people who strive to improve and serve the community. They contribute and are very active in the group, trying to get themselves involved in any forms of Australian curricular. In order to implement things realisically from real life, the Australian Hierarchal Promotion Protocol was created.

The Australian Hierarchal Promotion Protocol was created to ensure that all users have the equal chance of achieving a specialised role in Australia. We believe in equality between the citizens in terms of opportunity. It's a matter of proficiency which allows this to happen.
